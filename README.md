# 🌏 JomExplore: A Gamified NFC Tourism App

JomExplore is a mobile tourism app designed to make exploring Malaysia’s heritage sites fun and rewarding. By scanning NFC tags at physical locations like Batu Caves or Mount Kinabalu, users unlock exclusive e-badges, collect digital souvenirs, and share their journey through an Instagram-style feed. The app gamifies local travel, encourages cultural appreciation, and builds a community of explorers — one badge at a time.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
```bash
* React Native (Expo Router) – Cross-platform mobile development
* Async Storage - Built in Storage
* TypeScript - App logic 
* NFC Tools – Tools to Write the NFC access on Android
* Framer Motion / React Native Reanimated – Badge unlock animations
* DeepSeek API - Integrated Bot JomAI
* GoogleMap API - Integrating Real Time World Map for Guidance
```

**🎯 Challenge & Approach**
1. Time Constraint
> ⏱️ Challenge: We only had approximately 48 hours to complete the task.
🚀 Approach: We assigned designated roles to each team member. Once a member completed their task, they would delegate the next task to another teammate to ensure continuous progress.

2. NFC Integration
>📱 Challenge: Due to limited experience, we were unable to implement the NFC feature directly into Expo Go.
🧠 Approach: We used a web-based workaround to demonstrate the concept and simulate the NFC scanning as part of our demo.

3. GitHub Coordination
>🔄 Challenge: We initially planned to use Flutter, but version control issues caused delays and conflicts.
🚀 Approach: We switched to React Native, which offered simpler Git integration and better collaboration during rapid development.

4. Frequent Bug Encounters
>🐞 Challenge: Despite early task completion, we encountered multiple bugs close to the submission deadline.
🧠 Approach: We conducted continuous quality checks and debugging sessions to ensure all core functionalities were working smoothly.
